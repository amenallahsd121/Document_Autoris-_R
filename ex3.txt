# Step 1: Interpretation of r
# The coefficient r represents the correlation between the components Y1 and Y2 of the vector Y.
# It measures the linear relationship between these two components. Values of r range from -1 to 1.



# Step 2(a): Generate n = 10,000 realizations of the independent vector Z = (Z1, Z2)
n <- 10000
Z <- mvrnorm(n, mu = c(0, 0), Sigma = diag(2))




# Step 2(b): Calculate the empirical mean of the vector Z
empirical_mean_Z <- colMeans(Z)
print(paste("Empirical mean of Z:", empirical_mean_Z))



# Step 2(c): Check if Z1 and Z2 are uncorrelated (independence check)
correlation_Z <- cor(Z[, 1], Z[, 2])
print(paste("Correlation between Z1 and Z2:", correlation_Z))



# Scatterplot to visualize independence
plot(Z[, 1], Z[, 2], main = "Scatterplot of Z1 vs Z2",
     xlab = "Z1", ylab = "Z2", col = "blue", pch = 16)



# Step 3: Fix r = 0.85 and construct matrix A such that Î£ = A * t(A)
r <- 0.85
Sigma <- matrix(c(2, r, r, 2), nrow = 2)
A <- chol(Sigma)



# Step 4(a): Generate n realizations of vector Y = A * Z
Y <- Z %*% t(A)

# Step 4(b): Estimate the coefficient r from Y
estimated_r <- cor(Y[, 1], Y[, 2])
print(paste("Estimated r:", estimated_r))



# Step 4(c): Scatterplot of Y2 as a function of Y1
plot(Y[, 1], Y[, 2], main = "Scatterplot of Y1 vs Y2",
     xlab = "Y1", ylab = "Y2", col = "red", pch = 16)



# Optional: Add a density plot to study the relationship more visually
library(ggplot2)
df_Y <- data.frame(Y1 = Y[, 1], Y2 = Y[, 2])
ggplot(df_Y, aes(x = Y1, y = Y2)) +
